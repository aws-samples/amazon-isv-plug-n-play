## Overview

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS offloads the undifferentiated heavy lifting of keeping the lights on by automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. Amazon RDS frees Startups to focus on higher-level efforts such as performance tuning, schema design, and developing new application features.

The ISV Plug 'n Play program consists of a packaged bundle that Startups can leverage to accelerate the migration of on-premises databases into Amazon RDS or Aurora.
